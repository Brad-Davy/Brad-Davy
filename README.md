## About Me

Hi, I'm Brad Davy, a **Research Software Engineer** with a focus on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and the development of **parallel code** to tackle large-scale scientific and technical problems. I enjoy utilising the power of distributed computing systems to optimise performance and scalability in computational research.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you're interested in collaborating!
