## About Me

Hi, I'm Brad Davy, a passionate **Research Software Engineer** with a focus on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and the development of **parallel code** to tackle large-scale scientific and technical problems. I enjoy harnessing the power of distributed computing systems to optimize performance and scalability in computational research.

In addition to HPC, I love working with **Python**, which I often use to create efficient, easy-to-maintain solutions for various tasks, ranging from scientific computing to data processing and graphical user interfaces. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible with software in the research domain.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you're interested in collaborating!
